Lab 02-09: Is this stealing?
</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
In <a href="../lab01-28/index.html" target="new">Lab 01-28</a> you determined an individual faculty member's schedule based on information that was 
dropped into a textarea.
In this problem, you are to do the same thing, except automatically pull it from the university's website.
</p>


<h3>
The Assignment
</h3>

<p>
Look at the <a href="http://www.bemidjistate.edu/academics/schedule/2016/spring/all/cs/" target="new">computer science schedule for this semester</a>.
It contains all of the information (and then some) that was in the sample data file that was provided with the earlier lab.
Study the page source for the file.
In particular notice two things. First, the select element for the subjects is closely tied to particular URLs.
You will need to copy this into the HTML landing page for this assignment.
Second, notice the table that holds the course schedule data.
Your PHP program will process this file, throwing out all of the bits except the pertinent rows of this table.
</p>

<p>
This is a good chance to apply a number of problem solving techniques. 
The first is to determine the pattern that exists in the URLs and the one 
in the table.
Another is to break this problem into smaller problems and then write functions
to solve the smaller problems. 
</p>

<p>
Once you have completed the new file, save a copy 
in your cs3270-TurnIn/lab02-09 folder.
This is due by the start of class on February 16.
